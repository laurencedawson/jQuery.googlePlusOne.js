# About jQuery.googlePlus.js

jQuery.googlePlus.js is a simple plugin for quickly adding Google +1 buttons to a page. Unlike the standard Google+ button, this plugin will not contact Google for any assets (images / javascript) until the user hovers over the button intently expressing an interest. Why bother? The minified plugin is very small (~2kb) and contains the default assets encoded in base64 to reduce http requests. This means that when a user visits a page with multiple +1 buttons on, all buttons will load immedieaty and removes the noticable lag / flicker of assets being loaded that is currently seen with the code from Google.
